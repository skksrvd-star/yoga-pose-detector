- **How:** Server-side rendering, automatic code splitting
- **Benefit:** Fast initial load, SEO-friendly

#### ✅ **Tailwind CSS**
- **Why:** Utility-first, rapid development, small bundle
- **How:** Pre-defined utility classes
- **Benefit:** Consistent design, responsive by default

#### ✅ **Canvas for Skeleton**
- **Why:** High performance, smooth animations
- **How:** Direct pixel manipulation at 30 FPS
